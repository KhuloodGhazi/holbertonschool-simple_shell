.SH NAME
hsh \- simple UNIX command line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
[\fIcommand\fR ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple shell developed for the Holberton School project. It functions as a basic command-line interpreter that reads input from standard input or a file, processes commands, and executes them.

The shell supports executing commands with arguments, managing environment variables, and handling built-in commands such as
.B exit
and
.B env.

.SH FUNCTIONALITY
.TP
Displays a prompt and waits for user input.
.TP
Executes commands either by their full path or by searching for them in the PATH environment variable.
.TP
Handles commands with arguments and pipes.
.TP
Exits the shell using the
.B exit
command or Ctrl+D (EOF).
.TP
Displays environment variables with the
.B env
command.
.TP
Handles both interactive and non-interactive modes.
.TP
Forks and executes child processes for command execution.
.TP
Provides error messages consistent with the standard `/bin/sh`.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
.TP
.B exit [status]
Exit the shell with an optional status code.

.TP
.B env
Prints the current environment variables.

.SH MAIN LOOP
The shell operates with a continuous loop where it waits for user input, processes the command, and executes it. If the command is not found, an error message is displayed. The shell handles input with the following steps:
1. Reads input from the user or a file.
2. Parses the input into arguments.
3. Executes the command via a forked process.
4. Exits or continues based on the input.

.TP
To start the shell, simply run:
.B
./hsh

Then, enter a command like:
.B
ls -l /tmp

You can also pipe or redirect commands:
.B
echo "ls" | ./hsh

.SH FILES
.TP
.I shell.h
Header file containing function prototypes, macros, and external variables used by the shell, such as:
  .B environ: A global variable representing the environment of the current process.
  .B Function prototypes for core operations: `execute_command()`, `handle_input()`, and `find_command_path()`.

.TP
.I exec_cmd.c
Contains functions for executing commands, finding the command path, and handling the execution process, including `search_path_dirs()`, `find_command_path()`, and `execute_command()`.

.TP
.I main.c
Contains the shell's main loop and input handling, including functions like `handle_input()` for reading, parsing, and executing commands.
